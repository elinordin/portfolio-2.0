# Portfolio 2.0 - Work in progress :warning:
My new portfolio created using create-react-app


### :checkered_flag: Goals:
- [x] Redesign and build a new portfolio that I am proud to show. I want to make a clean and interactive website that lets the user explore but still makes it easy to find the most essential information. I also want to send of a professional but playful vibe with the design and make the visitor curious to know more.
- [x] Try out SASS
- [x] Practice making user stories in my Kanban board
- [ ] Apply and practice testing


### :closed_book: Learnings:
* More experience with React 
* Exploring Github-Projects and how helpful it is to work with a Kanban-board to keep on track
* Tried out Sass which I really enjoyed
* Cross-browser testing is a good thing to have in mind throughout the whole project (background-blur is not available in Firefox for example)
* A11y-learnings and mindset (for example I re-factored my switches I think 4 times to make them more accessible), next time I will have those learnings in mind directly instead of remaking the same component
* Going back to a previous project (I re-used and refactored some code from a previous brief to fetch my language-data from the github-API) can really help to see my own progress and how much I've learned in just a few months
* Asking for feedback on my prototype from my classmates before starting to develop it was really valuable and made my end-product much better
* More practice and better understanding of Adobe Illustrator
* More in-depth figma skills - components, variables and animations
* Basic understanding of Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager
