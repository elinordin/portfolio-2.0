# Portfolio 2.0 - Work in progress :warning:
My new portfolio created using create-react-app


### :checkered_flag: Goals:
Redesign and build a new portfolio that I am proud to show. I want to make a clean and interactive website that lets the user explore but still makes it easy to find the most essential information. I also want to send of a professional but playful vibe with the design and make the visitor curious to know more.
